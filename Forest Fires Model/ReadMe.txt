Make sure when compiling to have the “gnuplot_i.hpp” header in the same folder as ForestFires.cpp

Please compile the ForestFires.cpp program using the standard g++ commands:

g++ -o ForestFires.out ForestFires.cpp

When running the program, the default settings should create a gnuplot output which will display the forest once per second as the algorithm progresses for 150 seconds.
The user can change the settings of the program including size of grid, probability values, number of steps, and the output settings (e.g. printing to console instead of with gnuplot). 
Please increase the size of the gnuplot window if it appears too small, and if printing to console a smaller forest size (e.g. 40*40) is recommended to display correctly.

Thank you!
